This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Second, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Third, for Sanity management or running the local sanity service.
Navigate to sanity-em-shop and run:
```
sanity manage 
sanity start
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) for local Sanity dashboard.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
